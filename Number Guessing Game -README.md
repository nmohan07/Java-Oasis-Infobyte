Task  - Number Game

This is a Number Game created for Oasis Infobyte Internship

The fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:

1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
 
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.

3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.

4. The game continues under the user guessing the number.

We have to Genrate a random number within the given range. Make user guess what number is genrated by the code. Compare the user guess and genrated value to show if the guess no. is higher or lower than the genrated number. We have to repeat the code until user guesses the correct number or give limited attempts.
